	In this project, I implemented a deep Q-learning algorithm for a treasure hunt game. My main task was to complete the qtrain function, which trains an agent to navigate a maze and find treasure. I created the exploration-exploitation strategy, experience replay mechanism, and neural network training loop.
	As a computer scientist, I solve complex problems by breaking them down and developing algorithms. This project involved teaching an agent to navigate efficiently, which has applications in robotics and optimization. I approach problems by understanding requirements, then designing solutions balancing efficiency and effectiveness.
	Ethically, I must ensure algorithms are fair and transparent. Even for this game, real-world adaptations would require considering safety and privacy. I'm responsible for developing efficient, reliable code, proper documentation, and considering scalability of projects. This project reinforced the importance of clean code, testing, and algorithm design.
